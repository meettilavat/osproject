            <h1>What is Shortest Remaining Time First Method?</h1>
            <p><b>Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)</b> is the preemptive version of Shortest Job Next (SJN) algorithm, where the processor is allocated to the job closest to completion.</p>
            <p>This algorithm requires advanced concept and knowledge of CPU time required to process the job in an interactive system, and hence canâ€™t be implemented there. But, in a batch system where it is desirable to give preference to short jobs, SRT algorithm is used.</p>
            <p>However, SRT involves more overheads than SJN, as the OS is required to frequently monitor the CPU time of the jobs in the READY queue and perform context switching. </p>
            <h1>Characteristics of FCFS Scheduling</h1>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>It supports non-preemptive and pre-emptive scheduling algorithm.</li>
                <li>Jobs are always executed on a first-come, first-serve basis.</li>
                <li>It is easy to implement and use.</li>
                <li>This method is poor in performance, and the general wait time is quite high.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Advantages</h1>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Many processes execute in less amount of time. So, throughput is increased.</li>
                <li>Processes which have short burst time run fast.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Disadvantages</h1>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Practically it is not possible to predict the burst time.</li>
                <li>Processes which have long burst time will have to wait for long time for execution.</li>
            </ul>
