            <h1>What is Round Robin?</h1>
            <p>The name of this algorithm comes from the round-robin principle, where each person gets an equal share of something in turns. It is the oldest, simplest scheduling algorithm, which is mostly used for multitasking.</p>
            <p>In Round-robin scheduling, each ready task runs turn by turn only in a cyclic queue for a limited time slice. This algorithm also offers starvation free execution of processes.</p>
            <h1>Characteristics of Priority Scheduling</h1>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Round robin is a pre-emptive algorithm</li>
                <li>The CPU is shifted to the next process after fixed interval time, which is called time quantum/time slice.</li>
                <li>The process that is preempted is added to the end of the queue.</li>
                <li>Round robin is a hybrid model which is clock-driven</li>
                <li>Time slice should be minimum, which is assigned for a specific task that needs to be processed. However, it may differ OS to OS.</li>
                <li>It is a real time algorithm which responds to the event within a specific time limit.</li>
                <li>Round robin is one of the oldest, fairest, and easiest algorithm.</li>
                <li>Widely used scheduling method in traditional OS.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Advantages</h1>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>It doesn’t face the issues of starvation or convoy effect.</li>
                <li>All the jobs get a fair allocation of CPU.</li>
                <li>It deals with all process without any priority</li>
                <li>If you know the total number of processes on the run queue, then you can also assume the worst-case response time for the same process.</li>
                <li>This scheduling method does not depend upon burst time. That’s why it is easily implementable on the system.</li>
                <li>Once a process is executed for a specific set of the period, the process is preempted, and another process executes for that given time period.</li>
                <li>Allows OS to use the Context switching method to save states of preempted processes.</li>
                <li>It gives the best performance in terms of average response time.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Disadvantages</h1>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>If slicing time of OS is low, the processor output will be reduced.</li>
                <li>This method spends more time on context switching</li>
                <li>Its performance heavily depends on time quantum.</li>
                <li>Priorities cannot be set for the processes.</li>
                <li>Round-robin scheduling doesn’t give special priority to more important tasks.</li>
                <li>Decreases comprehension</li>
                <li>Lower time quantum results in higher the context switching overhead in the system.</li>
                <li>Finding a correct time quantum is a quite difficult task in this system.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Algorithm</h1>
            <div class="algoc cent" style="width: auto!important; text-align: justify">
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Create an array of arrival time ar_time[] which keeps track of arrival time of process Pi</li>
                    <li>Create another array of burst time br_time[] which keeps track of remaining burst time</li>
                    <li>Initialize CPU time to 0; t = 0</li>
                    <li>Repeat these steps until ready queue is empty
                        <ul>
                            <li>if br_time[i] > quantum, t = t + quantum, br_time[i] -= quantum</li>
                            <li>else t = t + br_time[i], br_time = 0</li>
                        </ul>
