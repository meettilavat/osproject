            <h1>What is Shortest Job First Scheduling?</h1>
            <p><b>Shortest Job First (SJF)</b> is an algorithm in which the process having the smallest execution time is chosen for the next execution. This scheduling method can be preemptive or non-preemptive. It significantly reduces the average waiting time for other processes awaiting execution.</p>
            <h1>Characteristics of SJF Scheduling</h1>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>It is associated with each job as a unit of time to complete.</li>
                <li>This algorithm method is helpful for batch-type processing, where waiting for jobs to complete is not critical.</li>
                <li>It can improve process throughput by making sure that shorter jobs are executed first, hence possibly have a short turnaround time.</li>
                <li>It improves job output by offering shorter jobs, which should be executed first, which mostly have a shorter turnaround time.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>There are Two Types of SJF Methods</h1>
            <h2>Non-Preemptive SJF (Shortest Remaining Time First)</h2>
            <p>In non-preemptive scheduling, once the CPU cycle is allocated to process, the process holds it till it reaches a waiting state or terminated.</p>
            <h2>Preemptive SJF</h2>
            <p>In Preemptive SJF Scheduling, jobs are put into the ready queue as they come. A process with shortest burst time begins execution. If a process with even a shorter burst time arrives, the current process is removed or preempted from execution, and the shorter job is allocated CPU cycle.</p>
            <h1>Advantages</h1>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>Maximum throughput</li>
                <li>Minimum average waiting and turnaround time</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Disadvantages</h1>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>May suffer with the problem of starvation.</li>
                <li>It is not implementable because the exact Burst time for a process can't be known in advance.</li>
            </ul>
            <h1>Algorithm</h1>
            <div class="algoc cent" style="width: auto!important; text-align: justify">
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Sort all the processes according to their arrival time.</li>
                    <li>Select the process with minimum arrival time as well as minimum burst time.</li>
                    <li>After completion of the process, select from the ready queue the process which has the minimum burst time.</li>
                    <li>Repeat above processes untill all processes have finished their execution.</li>
                </ul>
